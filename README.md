# MIS-4173---Final-Bachelor-Project
This is my final bachelor capstone project I worked on at East Carolina University. I was part of the student team "River Runners Technology".  The whole project was created in team work with my fellow students Erik Tiltman, Chris Calbi and Adam Noonan.


Client: James River Runner Technologies selected an outside organization to work with
for our capstone project requirement. James River Runners, a legal document delivery service that
operates out of central Virginia. After selecting an organization, we began working with project
stakeholders on analyzing the current business environment, discussing major business needs and areas
for business process improvements. It slowly became clear exactly where our team can make a difference
and that our project would be a business process automation endeavor.

Our project team for the capstone MIS 4173 project have been given the task of updating
the delivery system for James River Runners, owned by David McCallum. For this portion of our
report we looked at the specifics of how we train the owner who will be using the account to help
him gain more advantage within the market he competes in.
